     "This notebook shows how to preprocess data in CONLL format, which is quite popular for storing the NLP datasets, for Knodle framework.\n",
     "\n",
     "To show how it works, we have taken a relation extraction dataset based on TAC KBP corpora (Surdeanu (2013)), also used in Roth (2014). The TAC dataset was annotated with entity pairs extracted from Freebase (Google (2014)) where corresponding relations have been mapped to the 41 TAC relations types as used in the TAC KBP challenges (e.g., per:schools_attended and org:members). \n",
     "\n",
     "In order to show the whole process of weak annotation, we have reconstructed the entity pairs and used them to annotate the dataset from scrath. As development and test sets we used the gold corpus annotated via crowdsourcing and human labeling from KBP (Zhang et al. (2017)).  \n",
     "\n",
     "Importantly, in this dataset we preserve the samples, where no rule matched, as __negative samples__, what is considered to be a good practice in many NLP tasks, e.g. relation extraction. \n",
     "\n",
     "The steps are the following:\n",
     "- the input data files are downloaded from MINIO database: \n",
     "    - raw train data saved in .conll format\n",
     "    - gold-annotated dev data saved in .conll format\n",
     "    - gold-annotated test data saved in .conll format\n",
     "    - list of rules (namely, Freebase entity pairs) with corresponding classes\n",
     "    - list of classes\n",
     "- list of rules with corresponding classes is transformed to mapping_rules_labels t matrics\n",
     "- the non-labelled train data are read from .conll file and annotated with entity pairs. Basing on them, rule_matches_z matrix and a DataFrame with train samples are generated\n",
     "- the already annotated dev and test data are read from .conll file together with gold labels and stored as a DataFrame.\n"
