    "The aim of this project is to find names of people killed by the police in a corpus of news paper articles. The corpus was created by Katherine A. Keith et al. (2017) for a similar task using distant supervision. This dataset contains mentions of people (based on keywords related to “killing” or “police”) who might have been killed by the police. The dataset (the HTML documents scraped in 2016 themselves as well as the already sentence-segmented data) are available on the [project’s website](http://slanglab.cs.umass.edu/PoliceKillingsExtraction/) and on [MinIO]( https://knodle.dm.univie.ac.at/minio/knodle/datasets/police_killing/). \n",
    "There is a train and a test dataset, both of them containing dictionaries with the following keys:\n",
    "\n",
    "-\tdocid: unique identifiers of every mention of a person possible killed by the police\n",
    "-\tname: the normalized name of the person\n",
    "-\tdownloadtime: time the document was downloaded\n",
    "-\tnames_org: the original name of the person mentioned in the document\n",
    "-\tsentnames: other names in the mention (not of the person possibly killed by the police)\n",
    "-\tsent_alter: the mention, name of the person possible killed by the policed replaced by “TARGET”, any other names replaced by “POLICE”\n",
    "-\tplabel: for the training data possibly erroneous labels obtained using weak supervision and gold labels for the test data – in this project, only the labels of the test data will be used\n",
    "-\tsent_org: the original mention\n",
    "\n",
    "Compared to the [Data Preprocessing with RegExt Tutorial](https://github.com/knodle/knodle/blob/feature/%23299_police_killing_dataset/examples/data_preprocessing/police_killing/data_preprocessing_with_regex.ipynb), where RegEx are used in order to cover various different ways a sentence might indiciate that someone was killed by the police, the rules that are used in this tutorial are simple word pairs (one of the killing and one of the police related keywords each). A rule matches a sample if both of the words in the wordpair are part of the sample. Except the rules that are used, everything is done in the same way as in the alternative tutorial. \n",
